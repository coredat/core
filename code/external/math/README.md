# Math

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/republic-of-almost/math.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/republic-of-almost/math)

This is a header only math library that built up in my hobby projects. I've extracted it and put it up here for anybody who wants it use it. Its a no-nonsense floating point math library.


## Support For
floating point vector types (2,3 and 4), floating point matrix types (3x3 and 4x4), floating point quaternion type, and some general math operations.


## SIMD Status
There is partial SIMD support. Only vector types have it. To enable it, its recomeneded you build your project with preprocessor definition `MATH_USE_SIMD`
